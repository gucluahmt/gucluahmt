Senior Business Analyst | Python | SQL | Data Validation | Financial Systems | Data-Driven Strategy

As a Senior Business Analyst in the financial services industry, I combine deep expertise in capital markets, regulatory reporting, and data validation with a passion for continuous growth and cross-functional learning.

In addition to delivering business analysis solutions in trading and compliance environments, I proactively explored adjacent domains such as Customer Retention Analysis and Portfolio Risk Scoring.  
These self-initiated projects demonstrate my growth mindset and ability to independently design, develop, and deliver end-to-end data-driven solutions aligned with real-world business needs.

## 🧠 Approach and Mindset

Each project in my portfolio is the result of independently identifying business challenges, designing data pipelines, validating data quality, and delivering actionable insights.  
I believe in bridging the gap between raw data and strategic decision-making by combining technical proficiency (Python, SQL, data modeling) with business acumen (risk management, client profiling, regulatory compliance).

I embrace a growth mindset, continuously expanding my capabilities across technical and business domains to drive better outcomes in complex financial environments.
