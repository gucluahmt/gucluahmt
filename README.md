# Ahmet Guclu

**Business Analyst / Analyst | Capital Markets | SQL (SQL Server) | Python | Data Quality & Controls**

I build portfolio-based case studies in capital markets data controls—focused on trade surveillance, ETL validation, and exception reporting. Using SQL and Python, I design rule catalogs, validation checks (missing/duplicate/outliers), and audit-friendly outputs that mirror real-world data integrity workflows.

My projects emphasize clear documentation, reproducible pipelines, and practical testing artifacts (e.g., run metrics, exception summaries) to support reliable decision-making across trading, risk, and compliance contexts.
